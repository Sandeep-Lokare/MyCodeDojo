Description
==========
An investigation agency has amassed a large number of important case 
files on separate flash memory and portable drives. The agency now wish 
to copy these to permanent server storage. 

At present all files for a particular investigative case are stored in individual
directories bearing the name of the case.
It is desired to copy the whole directory structure from the portable storage 
device to permanent file storage as is.

This could be achieved using the simple “cp” command.
E.g. cp $1 $2
cp /mnt/sdb1 ~/my-documents/case_arch
However all of the files have default non-meaningful file names. (e.g. 
IMG_0123.jpg, IMG_0002.JPG, Document1.doc, Document2.docx) and 
it is required that these files are copied with more useful names based on 
the name of the parent directory.
For example if there is a directory called “clinton” containing the files, 
IMG_1234.jpg, IMG_4321.JPG and Document1.doc these should be 
copied to the “clinton” directory on the target drive but with the file names 
changed to clinton1.jpg, clinton2.JPG and clinton1.doc.
You have been asked to develop a Linux bash shell script which will 
reliably copy original case directories and files from the flash/portable drive 
to the permanent storage file space whilst automatically renaming as 
specified above.
It is also absolutely imperative for the company’s business that no file is
ever lost by being omitted or over-written.
The script will need to function with flash/portable drives potentially 
containing tens of thousands of files and should therefore be reasonably 
efficient in its operation.

SPECIFICATION
The case custom copy script must be named “cccp” and should be 
located in the ~/my-applications/bin directory. 
It will be used as:
cccp removable_pathname archive_dir_path
Examples:
$ cccp /mnt/sdb1 ~/my-documents/case_arch
$ cccp /mnt/sdb1 ../recordsarc
$ cccp sdb1 /root/records/archive
The first example above would copy all the files from /mnt/sdb1, and any 
sub-directories within this directory, to the ~/my-documents/case_arch
renaming the files in the process
1. The script should be efficient, robust and cope with possible user 
error.
o If the archive directory does not already exist, the script must
create it.
o If the archive directory is not empty then the script should 
report this as an error and then, as a precaution, terminate.
o If the source directory does not exist, the script should report 
an error.
o If the user omits either of the two arguments then the script 
should provide a helpful error message as in:-
“Usage : cccp source_path archive_path”
2. Care must be taken when renaming and copying files so that no 
files are copied with the same name as one already existing in the 
target directory, resulting in the loss of the latter.
3. Challenge.
The script may need to operate on very large collections of files. 
This means that, even if it is efficient, it still might take a long time to 
run.
Therefore the script should include checks to make sure that 
another instance of the script is not already in operation before it 
starts. If another instance of the script is running then the second 
one should terminate with an error message.
